# Background

I'm a lifelong lover of tech and I'm at my best when 
working with logic based problems. I am a recent graduate of Makers Academy 
where my love for writing clean code has been eternally solidified.
I have taken on two mentees from two cohorts behind my own and am enjoying
teaching them Ruby, Javascript, and Test Driven Development.

Prior to Makers I worked as an Electrician, which I also pursued for my love of 
all things techy. Having learned about coding bootcamps, I decided to leap at 
the opportunity to get a job in an industry I had always dreamed of working in.

# Skills

### Problem Solving/Logic

I have always considered myself a skilled problem solver and have thrived as one during my time coding. I love being challenged and the majority of my favourite moments at Makers were also the most challenging. I have garnered a love for TDD and using pragmatic concepts such as test triangulation to methodically break a problem down into sizeable chunks, and I now have a passion for seeing the red turn green.

### Clean Code/Attention to detail

Having worked as an Installation Electrician prior to joining Makers, I'm more than familiar with delivering high-quality work that meets the clients' specification. My professional career prior to coding was always focused on group projects where I read drawings and follow specifications with very little margin for adjustment, and at Makers, this skillset has given me the foresight to meet acceptance criteria the first time around.
At Makers, having clean, well-tested code is something I find very rewarding and something I have become proud of during my time at Makers Academy. I have enjoyed taking time towards the end of a project to scan my group's code, to get an understanding of what is going on, to see what can be made DRY or written better, and to do some refactoring after discussions with the group. I find that I am not completely satisfied by a functioning product until the code looks nice and is easy for other developers to read.


### Teamwork/Leadership

I am a strong communicator in cross-functional teams, as demonstrated in my electrical career. I've worked in small teams to complete small projects and I've worked with large teams on developments that have taken upward of 12 months to complete. I am comfortable taking the lead in a group setting and also get a lot of enjoyment from helping people. Because of this, I decided to take on two mentees from two cohorts behind my own at Makers Academy. I have really enjoyed helping them through their Makers journeys and the experience has shown me that helping people to learn to code is something that I am good at. 


# Interests

- I have a lifelong interest in gaming and more recently esports. I have always been a big user of the Internet and spend a lot of time at my PC, whether it's for knocking around on message boards or playing games with friends.
- I have played guitar for 17 years and began taking piano lessons in late 2019. Music and instruments are a big part of my life and I play almost daily, whether that is to play with other people or practise to improve on my musical vocabulary.
