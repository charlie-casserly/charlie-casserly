# Background

I am a full-stack developer, having recently graduated from Makers' Academy
16 week coding bootcamp. I'm a lifelong lover of tech and I'm at my best when 
working with logic based problems. I always knew I would love coding, but
Makers' allowed me to realise just how well suited to writing code I am.
I have also taken on two mentees from two cohorts behind my own and am enjoying
teaching them Ruby, Javascript, and Test Driven Development.
I have now left the course eager to take this learning experience further 
and add to my knowledge.

Prior to Makers I worked as an Electrician, which I also pursued for my love of 
all things techy. Having learned about coding bootcamps, I decided to leap at 
the opportunity to get a job in an industry I had always dreamed of working in.

# Skills

### Leadership

I am able to showcase my leadership skills in helping my team's project ideas come into fruition. I am comfortable taking the lead in a group setting and also get a lot of enjoyment from helping people. Because of this, I decided to take on two mentees from two cohorts behind my own at Makers Academy. I have really enjoyed helping them through their Makers journeys and the experience has shown me that helping people to learn to code is something that I am good at. 

### Problem Solving/Logic

I have always considered myself a skilled problem solver and have thrived as one during my time coding. I love being challenged and the majority of my favourite moments at Makers were also the most challenging. I have garnered a love for TDD and using pragmatic concepts such as test triangulation to methodically break a problem down into sizeable chunks, and I now have a passion for seeing the red turn green.

### Clean Code

Having clean, well-tested code is something I find very rewarding and something I have become proud of during my time at Makers Academy. I have enjoyed taking time towards the end of a project to scan my group's code, to get an understanding of what is going on, to see what can be made DRY or written better, and to do some refactoring after discussions with the group. I find that I am not completely satisfied by a functioning product until the code looks nice and is easy for other developers to read.

### Attention to detail

Having worked as an Installation Electrician prior to joining Makers, I'm more than familiar with delivering high-quality work that meets the clients' specification. My professional career prior to coding was always focused on group projects where I read drawings and follow specifications with very little margin for adjustment, and at Makers, this skillset has given me the foresight to meet acceptance criteria the first time around.

### Communication/Teamwork

I am a strong communicator in cross-functional teams, as demonstrated in my electrical career. I tend to enjoy working as a team and seeing a collective amount of hard work come together to form something solid. I've worked in small teams to complete small projects and I've worked with large teams on developments that have taken upward of 12 months to complete. I would list my communication skills as one of my biggest strengths, which is why group projects at Makers were by far my favourite moments up to date in my code learning experience. 


# Interests

- I have a lifelong interest in gaming and more recently esports. I have always been a big user of the Internet and spend a lot of time at my PC, whether it's for knocking around on message boards or playing games with friends.
- I have played guitar for 17 years and began taking piano lessons in late 2019. Music and instruments are a big part of my life and I play almost daily, whether that is to play with other people or practise to improve on my musical vocabulary.
